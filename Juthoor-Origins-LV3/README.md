LV3 is the **theory + validation blueprint**. It builds on LV2 outputs (ranked leads + QA) and defines how to move from **discovery** to **stricter hypothesis testing**.


## Role in the stack ??

LV3 tests hypotheses that an older Arabic format (possibly binary roots) could be a
source for multiple language families, using LV2 outputs as evidence inputs.

## Project map 🧭

## Start here 📌

- Main document: `Master FoundationV3.2.md`
- Docs navigation: `docs/README.md`
- Ordered plan: `docs/ROADMAP.md`

## What LV3 covers ✅

- Hypotheses, constraints, and what counts as "evidence"
- Anchor policy and corridor tags for interpretation
- A validation track design that consumes LV2 artifacts

To obtain the LV2 artifacts that LV3 validates, see `docs/GETTING_LV3_OUTPUTS.md`.
