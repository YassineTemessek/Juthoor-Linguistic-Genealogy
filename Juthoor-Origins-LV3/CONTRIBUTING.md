# Contributing (LV3)

This repository is documentation-first: it defines the LV3 theory + validation blueprint.

Project map:

- LV0: `Juthoor-DataCore-LV0` — Data ingestion and normalization
- LV1: `Juthoor-ArabicGenome-LV1` — Arabic root system decoding
- LV2: `Juthoor-CognateDiscovery-LV2` — Cross-lingual cognate discovery
- LV3: `Juthoor-Origins-LV3` — Theory synthesis and validation (this repo)
- App: `Quran-Corpus-Analysis` — Quranic semantic analysis

## What to change here

- Improve clarity and structure in `Master FoundationV3.2.md`
- Add supporting docs under `docs/`
- Add templates (concept/lexeme/lead/corridor cards) under `docs/templates/`

## Style guidelines

- Prefer short sections and explicit headings.
- Keep claims separate from evidence plans.
- When adding a new policy/rule, include:
  - why it exists
  - how it is tested (or how it will be tested in validation)
  - what would falsify it

## Versioning policy

- Do not overwrite the meaning of an existing "vX.Y" Master Foundation.
- Create a new file for major revisions (e.g., `Master FoundationV3.3.md`) and link it from `README.md`.
