# Raw Data Flow (LV3)

LV3 consumes LV1 and LV2 outputs. Raw data flow is owned by LV0.

Summary:
- LV0 produces data/processed outputs.
- LV1 produces the Arabic genome (binary root → word lists with meanings).
- LV2 generates ranked cognate leads.
- LV3 uses those leads + genome data for validation and theory synthesis.
