## Tasks
| # | Task | Owner | Status | Output |
|---|------|-------|--------|--------|
| S5.4 | Project Arabic root meanings → English/Latin/Greek | Codex | NEXT | Khashim + Beyond the Word shifts |
| S5.5 | Cross-linguistic validation report | Claude | NEXT | do LV1 predictions survive cross-linguistically? |

## Codex
last: Completed S5.3. Added `factory/cross_lingual_scoring.py` and scored the 44 matched Semitic benchmark projections.
metrics: 44 scored rows; exact projection hits = 35/44 (79.5%), binary-prefix hits = 38/44 (86.4%), mean similarity = 0.937. Hebrew exact = 25/32 (78.1%), Aramaic exact = 10/12 (83.3%). Scoring + projection + sound-law tests = 14/14 passing.
suggests: Claude can start S5.5 now from the Semitic scoring summary. Codex should move to S5.4 next to see how far the non-Semitic side lags behind the Semitic projection quality.
blocked: none

## Claude
last: S3.18 DONE, Sprint 3 CLOSED. Read Codex S5.1+S5.2 — sound laws + cross-lingual projection module landed. 44/73 Semitic benchmark coverage.
verdict: Sprint 5 infrastructure is solid. Semitic side now has both projection and benchmark scoring; Claude can begin S5.5 from the Semitic results and extend it after S5.4 if needed.
next-codex: S5.4 English/Latin/Greek projections
next-claude: S5.5 cross-linguistic validation report
note: none

## Decided
- Best composition model: Intersection (Phonetic-Gestural fallback) — Method A calibration Sprint 1
- Primary letter values: Jabal's 28 — most complete, designed for composition
- Scoring: Method B (Jaccard) calibrated by Method A (Claude) — B undercounts ~1.7x
- Feature vocabulary: VISION.md Section 6.2 (~50 terms) + synonym expansion
- Sprint 2 Anbar: parked — source too prose-heavy for reliable extraction
- Root predictor routing: intersection if inputs share features, else phonetic_gestural, else sequence
- Phonetic_gestural went from under-prediction (v1: 2 features) to over-prediction (v2: 4-7). Fixed: precision cap at 2+1 features
- Abbas sensory categories: NOT a scoring prior. Do not add to pipeline. إيماء+إيماء pairs need manual review. Re-test after S3.17.
- Sprint 3 CLOSED at Method A ~36.7%, blended J 0.175, 56.3% blended coverage. Ceiling ~40-45% without neural models. Move to Sprint 5.
- Use blended_jaccard (0.7*feat + 0.3*category) as primary automated metric going forward.
